Graphite is great.

Collectd has piles of plugins.

Let's glue them together.

In collectd.conf, put this:

<Plugin write_http>
  <URL "http://monitor:3012/post-collectd">
  </URL>
</Plugin>

Then run this little javascript bit in node. It will take data from collectd
and ship it to graphite.

This is a work in progress. It also may not stay in node/javascript since I
don't really care for the platform.
